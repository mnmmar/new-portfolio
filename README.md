# new-portfolio

Approach Taken:
I wanted to learn how to use C# with the Dotnet Framework. I ended up using it as a backend in this projuect with the React frontend and MongoDB database. I decided to take things reallly slow to absorb the information and avoid burn out. So instead of doing everything at once, I tackled C# first like Matt suggested. I focused on the landscape terminal game, which surprisingly went really well! Afterwards, I focused on my portfolio and finished it up. I was saving the hardest for last (DotNet) because I was so intimidated. I even made a React app of a remake of the Epress app from unit 2 as Jason suggested just in case I can't figure it out. Afterwards, I tackled DotNet, which honestly is not as bad as I was making it out to be in my head! I just focused on the documents they had up on Microsoft and it was pretty self explanatory everytime I ran into a problem so that was super nice. I ended up building 4 projects because of that and honestly, I'm glad I did. I made good use of my time and got more practice. I just kept trying to remake the same project with each new technology and it honestly really helped me learn the differences. I was able to focus on using the new technologies more and not on the actual website idea itself.

Unsolved Problems:
Wow! I really thought deploying would be under this section but somehow I got it working! Can you believe it? Honestly, I really wanted to add user auth but after learning everything and making all the apps, I decided I just don't have enough time. I worked really slow but it's okay because I lesrned a lot. I will definitely make sure to add it in later on.
